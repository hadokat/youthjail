            <h3>Sequel Goes Into Hiding</h3>
            <p>The failure of the Sequel model slowly became apparent through several high-profile incidents including the death of 16 year old Cornelius Frederick at Lakeside Academy, a Sequel facility. His death was related to an improper “restraint” , a practice used throughout different facilities to address children deemed to be “out of control.” While several staff members ended up being charged criminally for the incident, improper training and a lack of resources across the company has created the framework for such incidents. Both sexual and physical abuse are well documented at many Sequal operated youth facilities including at Cedar Ridge Acadamy, an all-girls school designed to support survivors of child sexual abuse, which had the highest rate of sexual abuse reported at any youth residential facility in Utah (2018-2019). Despite Sequel's best efforts, repeated and high-profil instances of abuse, neglect, and negligence gained traction and several highly publicized national stories brought attention to the Sequel name through 2020 and 2021.</p>
            <p> In an apparent attempt to manage and mitigate this growing branding crisis, Sequel has quietly worked to dissociate the brand from its holdings. Prior to December of 2021 the Sequel website displayed the type of comprehensive information one would expect from a large healthcare or rehabilitative care company. Several iterations of Sequal’s website (<a href="sequelyouthservices.com">www.sequelyouthservices.com</a>) from 2005 onwards featured a list (and later an interactive map) with all of the locations operated by Sequel (addresses included), what each location specialized in, who was in charge of a given facility including email addresses and phone numbers for the directors of each facility, and an expansive list of contact information for different individuals and departments at Sequal’s corporate headquarters. Sometime between November 15, 2021 and December 16, 2021 this all changed (there are gaps in available web archives). </p>
            <p>Sequel relaunched their national website with a new version that included very little information. The current version of the website features a single page with no menu and only one brief quote above a generic stock photo of a racially diverse group of smiling young adults. The quote reads, “we are passionate about what we do and delight in providing the individuals we are privileged to serve and instill permanent, positive change and propel them toward their best and full potential.” The remaining section of this single page includes a contact box where respondents can request Sequel reach out to them. The website no longer features information about the facilities Sequel operates, how to contact anyone within the organization directly, or even what types of services Sequel offers. </p>
            <p>This trend of reduced information and transparency has also taken place at a local level. SequelCare of Maine, which operates several facilities in the state, was discreetly rebranded to Brighter Heights Maine sometime between April 1, 2022 and early May, 2022. The original domain name (www.sequelcareofmaine.com) now redirects to www.bh-maine.com where a new website with the Brighter Heights Maine branding now sits. Interestingly, (possibly in an effort to reduce cost) all of the content, including photos and text has remained the same, with only one difference, the complete erasure of any ties to the Sequel brand. This strategy is being enacted for Sequel owned and operated locations nationwide. </p>
            <p>This defensive PR strategy demonstrates the risks of for-profit companies operating in quasi-carceral spaces with little oversight. Sequel’s response to public criticism over multiple well-documented instances of egregious conditions and negligent management has been to dismantle the brand and erase public ties between the national company and the local and regional facilities it operates and continues to extract profits from. Sequel seemingly wishes to make it more difficult for reporters, families, and taxpayers to connect the dots between troublesome facilities which operate with the imperative of driving value for shareholders. Sequel’s response to public outcry was not to take responsibility and invest in the improvement of conditions and increased transparency, but rather to deny, distract, and hide. This is the company that the majority of US states continue to trust with the management and supposed rehabilitation of their most vulnerable youth.</p>

            <h3>Long Creek</h3>
            <p>Long Creek disproportionately commits and detains youth of color, with racial disparities only getting worse. In the span of these three years, the amount of committed youth of color rose from 16% to 24% and the amount of detained youth of color rose from 20% 23% (Marcellin, pg. 7). This overrepresentation of youth of color demonstrates how Long Creek plays a role in the discrimination against POC within the carceral systems whether it be in the state of Maine or nationally.
            </p>
            <p>Youth of color are not the only marginalized groups in Long Creek; girls suffer from lack of gender specific services that can greatly benefit women. Studies conducted by the Vera Institute have noted to the DOC that “despite the fact that girls now make up an increasing proportion of the country’s juvenile justice population, there are few effective, evidence-based interventions that are targeted to girls.” (CCLP, pg. 67). These programs are especially important when considering the experiences and trauma that is specific to the girls in Long Creek. </p>
            <p>Long Creek is also unequipped to deal with their patients that are suffering from mental health crisis’s. Between 2018 and 2019, “65 percent of boys and 89 percent of girls committed to Long Creek received behavioral health services through Maine Care (Maine’s Medicaid program) in the year before admission” (Marcellin, pg. 5). These reports point to the ways in which the state uses institutions such as Long Creek that further ostracizes mental health issues and continues to harm disenfranchised identities. </p>
            <p>In line with the objectives of the course, we searched for ways in which we can move towards a framework of abolition in which Long Creek no long serves as a punitive and discriminatory institution under the guise of providing care for youth in Maine. Using the money that is put aside for Long Creek alone, we can shift the funding towards more community-based programming. Long Creek admits that funding towards these programs would be most helpful as staff and assessment teams agree youth in Long Creek are there because “there are no other places for those youth to go” (CCLP, pg. 106). It is this manner both Long Creek and SequelCare claim to provide care yet fail to deliver support to those who need it most. </p>
            <p>The closing of Long Creek faces a difficult political landscape. In a bill that proposed to close Long Creek by June 30th, 2023 that was successfully passed through both the Maine house and Senate was then vetoed by Governor Mill’s desk as she described the bill as “fundamentally flawed” because “Maine would become the only state in the nation without a secure facility to serve the needs of youth who require detention for some period because they represent a risk to themselves or others in the course of their rehabilitation,” (Miller, Portland Press Herald). </p>
            <p>The use of Long Creek as a placeholder of other institutions is not only towards the fault of Mills. The lack of access to affordable housing, drug and alcohol support has made Long Creek Maine judges feel pressure to detain youth as they have nowhere else to go. “Advocates, defense attorneys, prosecutors, judges, JCCOs, and DOC staff told the team that many youths are detained due to a lack of other options, even in cases where detention at Long Creek is inappropriate” (CCLP, pg. 82). These actions only further continue cycles of investment to Long Creek without considering where else those funds could go.</p>

            <h3>Kids for Cash</h3>
            <p>Two judges in Wilkes-Barre were ultimately found guilty accepting “judicial kickbacks”, or bribes, from private juvenile detention centers.  This would go on to be known as the Kids for Cash Scandal of 2008.  Upon accepting these bribes, the judges would give rather harsh punishments to juvenlines and have them allocated to the private youth detention centers that were paying off the judges.  According to Dr. Sandra Trappen, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at Penn State University, “an estimated 6,000 children, where an estimated 1,000-2,000 received excess sentences, were impacted by the judges’ crimes (Dr. Sandra Trappen, Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at Penn State University Kids for Cash).”  This all unfolded due to the higher demand for tough on crime policing, and apparently in this instance, tough on juvenile crime policing.  Youth detention centers began to realize that if they filled their institutions more regularly they could prosper quite lavishly.  </p>
            <p>The two prime conspiring judges in the Kids for Cash Scandal were Michael Conahan and Mark Ciavarella.  Conahan was easy to accept a plea deal and received a far less harsh punishment than Ciavarella, who continued to deny all allegations.  Ciavarella and his family even went so far to accuse Conahan of lying about the entire situation and basically played dumb as if he had never heard of such a thing (Trappen)  Ciavarella received 28 years in prison, in comparison to Conahan’s 17.5 year sentence.  Other guilty parties included many of the people who paid these judges off, ranging from attorney’s to people who worked for the profiting juvenile detention centers.  Although some level of justice was served, the same cannot be said for the youth “who were brought before Judge Mark Ciavarella and, without warning or the chance to offer a defense, found themselves pronounced guilty, shackled and sentenced to months of detention in a cockroach-infested jail (Larry Getlan, “Corrupt ‘Kids for Cash’ judge ruined more than 2,000 lives”).”</p>
